SecDB license model
===================

SecDB is released under a dual license model.

SecDB for open source projects
==============================

If you are developing and distributing Open Source applications under the GNU Affero General
Public License (AGPL), or the GNU General Public License (GPL) then you are free to use SecDB
under the GNU AGPL License, version 3. The formal terms of the AGPL can be found on the GNU
website (http://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl.html).
Any software that uses code under a AGPL is itself subject to the same AGPL licensing terms.

For licensing SecDB under alternate terms, you should contact the author at <info@omnibi.net>
to purchase a commercial license.

SecDB commercial license
========================

If you do not license the source code under the GPL, but still like to include SecDB in your
projects then you need to purchase a commercial license.

The Commercial License is an agreement between Omnibius, LLC, and an organization that does
not want to release its application source code. Commercially licensed customers get a 
commercially supported product with assurances from Omnibius, LLC. Commercially licensed users
are also free from the requirement of making their own application Open Source.

Rights granted by a commercial license:

* Selling software that includes SecDB to customers who install the software on their
  own machines
* Selling software that requires customers to install SecDB on their own machines
* Building a hardware system that includes SecDB and selling that hardware system to customers
  for installation at their own locations.

Specifically:

* If you include SecDB with an application that is not licensed under the AGPL or
  GPL-compatible license, you need a commercial license for using SecDB.
* If you develop and distribute a commercial application and as part of utilizing your
  application, the end-user must download a copy of SecDB; for each derivative work, you
  (or, in some cases, your end-user) need a commercial license of SecDB.
